<h1 align="center">ðŸŽ“ PROFFY</h1>

## ðŸ’¡ What is it?
Proffy is a project carried out in the second edition of NLW, on the Discovery trail that was taught by pilot Mayk Brito.
With Proffy you can find teachers, or even be a teacher. The plataform allows you to find available teachers based on your free time to study, and also allows you to be a teacher, so students can send you menssages to have your classes.

## ðŸš§ Changes
I did the second version of this project, which is available at figma, in addition to completing the challenges that Mayk left at the end of the week. They are:
- You can now delete schedules you don't want during registration
- Some design changes
- You cannot add new schedules if you haven't completely filled in the previous one
- Shows modal when you finish registration
